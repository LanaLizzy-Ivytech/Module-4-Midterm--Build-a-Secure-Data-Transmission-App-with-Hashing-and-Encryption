    Write a short explanation describing how their solution upholds confidentiality, integrity, and availability: Confidentiality is heavily improved by the symmetric encryption, which makes it harder for just anyone to understand without the key, and the SHA256 code, which creates a hash code, which is checked against the decrypted symmetric code to see if all checks out.
    Integrity is upheld by the hash comparison, as it compares the hash code from an encrypted and then decrypted file from Fernet and then SHA256 to the code from the file to SHA256. This ensures that nothing was changed about the message from the original version to the decoded version.
    Availability is upheld by using a file. The file is saved to the first user's computer, making it less likely to be lost. The code runs quickly, so it is very unlikely the second person will go without availability to the message.

  Explain the role of entropy and key generation in their implementation: The role of entropy can be seen in key, where it generates a seemingly random string of letters. This key is used to encrypt the message; without it, the message would only have one possible way to decrypt the code, making it very easy to see the message even past the SHA256. The key generation has to have some randomness, or it would be too easy for an attacker to guess. It also must be kept with a variable that never changes, as it needs to stay constant in order to decrypt the message.
